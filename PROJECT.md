# PROJECT.md - Current State Dashboard

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-07

## What This Is
**OneBox** is a privacy-first iOS/iPadOS app for processing PDFs and images entirely on-device. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for documents that respects your privacy.

**Target Users:** Anyone who works with PDFs and images on iPhone/iPad and cares about privacy.

## Core Principle - 100% OFFLINE

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Works in airplane mode | REQUIRED |
| No cloud services | REQUIRED |
| No API calls | REQUIRED |
| No internet needed | REQUIRED |
| All processing on-device | REQUIRED |

The app uses only the device's local storage, RAM, and CPU. Large files should be handled via streaming/chunking, not by loading everything into memory.

## Current State

### Working
- Images to PDF conversion
- PDF merge, split, compress
- PDF signing (interactive, touch-to-place)
- Image resize and compress
- Job queue with progress tracking
- Free tier (3 exports/day)
- Pro subscriptions (StoreKit 2)
- On-device search
- Workflow automation
- Page organizer with undo/redo
- Redaction with presets

### Broken / Blocked
- None currently

### Needs Testing
- **Redact PDF** - Completely rebuilt with precise character-level redaction:
  - Fixed file not saving (2 bugs: PDF context timing + ShareSheet deletion)
  - Redaction now actually works on scanned/image-based PDFs
  - **NEW**: Uses Vision's character-level bounding boxes (`VNRecognizedText.boundingBox(for:)`) to redact ONLY the exact matched text, not entire lines
  - Simplified UI - removed Automatic/Manual/Combined modes, single unified flow
- **Watermark PDF** - Multiple fixes applied, needs user verification:
  - Size slider now has dramatic effect (5%-50% for images, 2%-15% for text)
  - Density slider now has dramatic effect (0.6x to 5x spacing)
  - Previous fix: reduced tiling from 50x50 to 15x15
- **Organize PDF** - Fixed file persistence and multi-page rotation bug
- Some advanced workflow features may need verification

## Known Issues

| # | Severity | Issue | Location | Status |
|---|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Low | Swift 6 concurrency warnings (3) | MultipeerDocumentService, OnDeviceSearchService | Non-blocking |
| 2 | Info | "Update to recommended settings" | Xcode project | Informational |

**Resolved This Session:**
- **Workflow "Add Step" button not working** - Button set state variable that was never used, and available steps grid was hidden when no steps selected. Fixed by always showing steps grid.
- **Workflow completing silently** - After workflow ran, no success feedback was shown. Added success alert with "Share Result" option.

---

## Last Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-07

**What Was Done:**
- **Fixed Workflow "Create Custom Workflow" - Add Step button:**
  1. Removed unused `showingStepPicker` state variable
  2. Changed layout to always show available steps grid (was hidden when no steps selected)
  3. Users can now tap any step to add it to their workflow
- **Fixed Workflow success feedback:**
  1. Added success alert when workflow completes ("Workflow Complete")
  2. Added "Share Result" button to share processed files
  3. Added progress monitoring to show correct step number during execution

**What's Unfinished:**
- Workflow templates need user testing to verify they run correctly
- Redact PDF needs user testing

**Files Modified:**
- `OneBox/OneBox/Views/WorkflowConciergeView.swift` - Fixed Add Step, added success feedback

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test Redact PDF** - Verify file saving/sharing now works correctly
2. Test all features end-to-end
3. Address Swift 6 warnings (optional, non-blocking)
